<h1>Exercise: Learn FORTH</h1>

Open the following: <a href="http://nhiro.org/learn_language/FORTH-on-browser.html">In-browser FORTH environment</a>

<div>FORTH is a stack-based programming language invented in the 60s, but that is still used to this day in micro-controllers and elsewhere.</div>

<div>It is a great way to learn about stacks. You can define a new function like this:</div>

<pre>
: times-three 3 * ;
</pre>

<div>
This function expects a single argument on the stack, pushes a 3, and then calls * to multiply the two numbers. You can call it like this:
</div>

<pre>
4 time-three
</pre>

<div>
Then use . to print out the result (12), or just "drop" to throw it away.
</div>

<hr>

<div>
Your exercise is to create a function that evaluates the following:
</div>

<div>
$$f(x,y) = (x + 5)^2 - y$$
</div>

You should be able to test it like this:

<pre>
3 5 f .
</pre>

And it should print:

<pre>59</pre>
